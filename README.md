This repository contains 3 C programs. 
The restoring division of positive integers takes in 2 inputs, a dividend and a divisor. The output is given in the binary form after performing shifting, subtraction and restoring(where required).
The non restoring division of positive integers takes in 2 inputs, a dividend and a divisor. The steps include shifting, subtraction if the value is positive and addition if the value is negative. This does not require restoring.
Sample input: dividend:8 ; divisor:3 ; 
Sample output:Quotient::00000000000000000000000000000010 ; Remainder:00000000000000000000000000000010
